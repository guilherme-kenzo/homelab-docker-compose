# Heimdall

Heimdall is a personal dashboard for self-hosted applications. My install runs on port 8030 (see docker-compose.yaml). It uses Nginx, so no need for another full-fledged proxy server.

It uses a [linuxserver docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/linuxserver/heimdall/). 

# Configuration

Configuration is done by editing files in the config folder or directly through the web interface (prefered).
